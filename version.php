/**
 * A simple block that shows the user's enrolment status, and suggests him to (un)enroll (and login if needed)
 *
 * This plugin uses enrol_self module. If enrol_self is enabled for a given course,
 * this block will show user's enrolment status and suggest him/her to (un)enrol.
 * 
 * This allows to hide the Administration block that is usually responsible for displaying
 * an (un)enrolment link, and might not be wanted (confusing title, other options might appear, etc.)
 * 
 * Make sure to display it on "every page" so that it appears also on courses summary pages.
 * 
 * English and french versions included / versions anglaise et franÃ§aise incluses.
